Two notes:

C16 needs to be placed on its side with the leads bent 90 degrees. Follow the silkscreen for reference.

TR1, TR2, and Q4 need to be installed in a particular way. The leads should be barely inserted and soldered so most
of the length of the lead is above the board, and then the leads bent over around a cylindrical object like a pencil
so there's a gap between the part and the board. Please see the [imaged linked here](https://github.com/SirYancy/HUGHyrdronicsHosting/blob/main/Triac%20photo%20montage.png) for reference.

Please reach out if there are any questions. We will be happy to explain this installation further.
